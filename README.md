# CoxPH_Analysis_Simple

Purpose: Run multiple univariate analyses all at once along with a multivariate analysis at the end

Note:

- The multivariate analysis is using all significant univariate p-values < 0.1.

- This is an improvement on the below source's code, gathering all results in a .csv.
